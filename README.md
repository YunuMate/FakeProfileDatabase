# FakeProfileDatabase

FakeProfileDatabase is a Profile database that has 100+ fake profiles

You could use it for catfishing, hidiing your identity, etc.


# How it works:
The database is made to be run on the Windows operating system. Opening the .py file should print a random fake profile

The program will generate a random number using `profile = random.randint(1, 148)`

If the number is 58, it will print "profile_58" 
```py
if profile == 58 :
    print(profile_58)
```
